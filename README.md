# SwiftUI-Grid
A Custom SwiftUI API for GridLayout. Significantly simplifies the usage of [UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220/) and [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/215/) with the custom built view modifier that works on any SwiftUI `View`.

This API is a first-in-the-market attempt at simplyfing CollectionView APIs using SwiftUI, shipped before a native solution is introduced by Apple in WWDC 2020.  
This APi will automatically adapt UI elements to the current color scheme, accessibility, and dynamic font settings. These are significant challenges faced by developers when using previous APIs.
