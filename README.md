# SwiftUI-Grid
A Custom SwiftUI API for GridLayout. Significantly simplifies the usage of UICollectionView, UICollectionViewLayout, [UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/220/) and [UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/215/) with the custom built view modifier that works on any SwiftUI `View`.

This API is a first-in-the-market attempt at simplyfing CollectionView APIs using SwiftUI, shipped before a native solution is introduced by Apple in WWDC 2020.
